## Jack Henderson

I'm a **full stack junior web developer** and recent graduate of Europe's #1, highly selective software development bootcamp: [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com). I'm looking for a challenging role with an exciting team where I can contribute to crafting **beautiful, useful and evolvable** code.

My greatest strength is boundless curiosity and slight obsessiveness. I read broadly and voraciously, and spent several months learning to code for fun before considering it as a career. I have an ability to rapidly pick up new concepts and apply them. I studied Zoology and find evolution and design of particular interest; I love to see the design of code evolve from the consistent application of best practices Ã  la the Emergent Design Principle.

## Projects

Project | Description | Technologies
------------ | ------------- | -------------
PainLess | An app for those who suffer from chronic conditions such as Arthritis and IBS. Users track daily what they eat, how much they exercise and how severe their pain is. The app can help identify potential triggers, i.e. food which exacerbates their symptoms. The team focused on following agile methodologies and test driven development to the letter to perfect these skills. | Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Javascript, Chart JS, Capybara, Cucumber, Rspec, HAML, HTML, CSS  
Instagram | An Instagram clone; test |Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Capybara, Rspec, HAML, HTML, CSS
Bowling Challenge | Javascript, Jasmine

## Skills

#### Communication
I have a well-honed ability to research complex topics, break them down and present the ideas in easily digested form. I am often called articulate and enjoy the process of distilling a complex issue down to it's core components, particularly in a good debate.

#### Rapid Independent Learning
I'm intensely curious about almost anything, and spend much of my spare time reading non-fiction and striving to be less wrong about the world, especially ethics, evolution, neuropsychology and systems of behaviour.

#### Problem Solving Under Pressure
During my last job as an AV technician I was frequently put on the spot during an event to both assuage the client and deal with a technical issue, the nature of which was often entirely novel. This developed a good sense for dealing with stressed customers, as well as a confidence in my own ability to rapidly and calmly take stock, prioritise, and take decisive action.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January - March 2017)
Intensive three month software engineering bootcamp, honing the following skills:

- Object Oriented Design
- Test driven development
- Behaviour driven development
- Pair programming
- Agile methodologies and XP values
- Rapid uptake and implementation of new technologies

#### University of Liverpool (September 2011 - July 2015)

- BSc. Zoology (2:1)
- I focused on evolutionary ecology, evolutionary psycology, population dynamics and behavioural ecology, and wrote my dissertation on the phenotypic plasticity of the Venus Fly Trap, testing the viability of carnivory as an evolutionary strategy.

## Interests
- Generally picking up random skills: building a custom PC, memorizing a pack of cards, learning new juggling patterns, solving a Rubik's Cube in less than three minutes, playing chess etc.
- Reading: Currently influenced by Doing Good Better by Will MacAskill and Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
- Sports: I climb, hike, run, cycle and play football regularly, and completed a Triathlon in 2012.
- Travel: I've made multiple climbing and hiking trips around Europe as well as Central America and Australia
- Code! (of course)
- Volunteering: I have spent several months volunteering at various eco projects in Devon and Central America
- Meditation: for about 3 years now
