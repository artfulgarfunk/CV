## Jack Henderson

Developer in training at Makers Academy, fresh to the field of coding and keen to make my mark. My ideal job would be as a Full Stack Junior Developer as part of an organisation that has a data-driven approach to helping the world, embracing innovation and wholly freed from stuffy tradition. I wish to be constantly challenged and never to hear the phrase "that's just the way things are done around here" again. 

## Skills

#### Communication/Presentation Ability

Developed the ability to research complex topics, break them down and present the ideas in easily digested form, without compromising or dumbing down the key issues. This skill is imperative to a career in science, and is one which I developed considerably while studying at the University of Liverpool.
