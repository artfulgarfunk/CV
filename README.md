## Jack Henderson

I'm a **full stack junior web developer** and recent graduate of Europe's #1, highly selective software development bootcamp: [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com). I'm looking for a challenging role with an exciting team where I can contribute to crafting **beautiful and functional** code.

My greatest strength is boundless curiosity and slight obsessiveness. I read broadly and voraciously, and spent several months learning to code for fun before considering it as a career. I have a proven ability to rapidly pick up new concepts and apply them. I studied Zoology and find evolution of particular interest, and I love to see the design of code develop from the consistent application of best practices as per the Emergent Design Principle.

## Projects

Project | Description | Technologies | Demo
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
[PainLess](https://github.com/artfulgarfunk/final_project) | An app for those who suffer from chronic conditions such as Arthritis and IBS. Users track daily what they eat, how much they exercise and how severe their pain is. The app can help identify potential triggers, i.e. food which exacerbates their symptoms. The team focused on following agile methodologies and test driven development to the letter. Integrating a JS library proved a struggle, along with time constraints but we achieved an impressive 100% test coverage. | Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Javascript, Chart JS, Capybara, Cucumber, Devise, Rspec, Haml, HTML, CSS | Pending
[Instagram](https://github.com/artfulgarfunk/instagram-clone) | An Instagram clone where users can create an account, add photos and leave comments, as well as edit their own uploads. Testing image upload proved particularly tricky, however this was my first individual Ruby on Rails project. I'm pleased with how it came together after being built in essentially one weekend. |Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Capybara, Devise, Rspec, Haml, HTML, CSS, Paperclip | [InstaClone](https://secret-meadow-65953.herokuapp.com/)

## Skills

#### Communication
I am often called articulate and enjoy the process of distilling a complex issue down to its core components, particularly in a good debate.

#### Teamwork
Through extensive experience working in groups and a fairly social nature, I am comfortable and confident in such a setting and find it an excellent accelerator of learning. I enjoy the challenge of defining a problem and working it through with colleagues.

#### Rapid Independent Learning
I'm intensely curious about almost anything, and spend much of my spare time reading non-fiction and trying to be less wrong about the world, especially ethics, evolution and psychology.

#### Problem Solving Under Pressure
During my last job as an AV technician I was frequently put on the spot during an event to both assuage the client and deal with a technical issue, the nature of which was often entirely novel. This developed a good sense for dealing with stressed customers, as well as a confidence in my own ability to calmly take stock, prioritise, and take decisive action.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January - March 2017)
Intensive three month software engineering bootcamp, honing the following skills:

- Object Oriented Design
- Test driven development
- Behaviour driven development
- Pair programming
- Agile methodologies and XP values
- Rapid uptake and implementation of new technologies

#### University of Liverpool (September 2011 - July 2015)

- BSc. Zoology (2:1)
- I focused on evolutionary ecology, evolutionary psychology, population dynamics and behavioural ecology, and wrote my dissertation on the phenotypic plasticity of the Venus Fly Trap, testing the viability of carnivory as an evolutionary strategy.

## Interests
- Generally picking up random skills: building a custom PC, memorising a pack of cards, learning new juggling patterns, solving Rubik's Cube in less than three minutes, playing chess
- Reading: Currently influenced by Doing Good Better by Will MacAskill and Meditations by Marcus Aurelius

- Code: (of course)
- Volunteering: I have spent several months volunteering at various eco projects in Devon and Central America
- Meditation: for about 3 years now
