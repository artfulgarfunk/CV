## Jack Henderson

I'm a **full stack junior web developer** and recent graduate of Europes #1, highly selective software development bootcamp, Makers Academy. I'm looking for a challenging role at an exciting organisation where I can contribute to crafting beautiful, functional and **evolvable** code.

After cramming more learning than I thought possible into the last 3 months, I've honed my ability to rapidly comprehend and implement new and complex concepts, and have grown into a confident and competent junior developer, keen to learn and do more.

My greatest strength is endless curiosity; I read broadly and voraciously. I studied Zoology and in particular I find evolution and design fascinating, in particular I love to see the design of code evolve from the consistent application of best practices a la the Emergent Design Principle.

## Skills

#### Communication/Presentation Ability
I have the ability to research complex topics, break them down and present the ideas in easily digested form, without compromising or dumbing down the key issues. This skill is imperative to a career in science, and is one which I furthered considerably while studying at the University of Liverpool.

#### Independent Learning and Research
I'm intensely curious about almost anything, and spend the majority of my spare time reading non-fiction and striving to be less wrong about the world, in particular ethics, evolution, psychology and systems of behaviour.

#### Problem Solving Under Pressure
During my last job as an AV technician I was frequently put on the spot during an event to both assuage the client and deal with a technical issue, the nature of which was often entirely novel. This developed a good sense for dealing with stressed customers, as well as a confidence in my own ability to rapidly and calmly take stock, prioritise, and take decisive action.
